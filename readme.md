## General info

<details>
<summary>Click here to see general information about <b>Cipher</b>!</summary>
<b>Cipher</b> is a powerful application designed to encrypt and decrypt any text using the Caesar Cipher rot13 and rot47 algorithms. With Cipher, users can easily encode and decode messages that include both upper and lower case letters as well as numbers.

One of the most useful features of Cipher is its ability to store all previously developed words in a buffer. This
buffer can be easily saved to a file, so that users can access their encrypted or decrypted messages at any time.
Additionally, users can load previously saved files and import all of the previously developed words back into the
buffer.

The buffer in Cipher is organized to include not only the developed words, but also the status (encrypted or decrypted)
and the type of encryption used (rot13 or rot47). This allows users to easily keep track of their work and ensures that
they can quickly find the information they need.

With its powerful encryption capabilities and easy-to-use interface, Cipher is an essential tool for anyone who needs to
send or receive sensitive information securely.
